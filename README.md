# Computer-Vision-Affine-Transformation

Implemented a program that will implement an affine image transformation. The transformation must be given as an argument by the user. Think of the pixel in the middle of the image as the beginning of the axes. In other words, consider, in terms of the transformation to be applied, that this element has coordinates (0, 0).
The image around this point (and not around the top-left element of the image, as would be the case if we followed the default Python / Numpy numbering method). The dimensions of the output image must be equal to those of the input image. Use 'nearest neighbor' insert.
